Description: This R package is designed for identification and analysis of ceRNA-miRNA triplets via integration of miRNA and RNA expression data at specific miRNA expression level. CeRNAR integrates three main steps: identification of ceRNA pairs, segment clustering, and peak merging. In addition, it also provides some downstream analyses of identified ceRNA-miRNA triplets, including network analysis, functional annotation, and survival analysis.
